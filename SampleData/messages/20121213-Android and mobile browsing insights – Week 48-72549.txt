Hello,


This week there is no news summary, but a retrospective on smart devices shipments up to Q3 2012 from IDC and my interpretation of what to expect for 2013. You can find the file here: https://intranet.mozilla.org/images/e/eb/Mobile_devices_analysis_Q4_2012_-_12-12.pdf

and insights include:

* Tablets are growing strongly, but are still a fraction of smartphones
* North America, Western Europe and Asia - Pacific are the main regions for smart device shipments
* iOS seems to have reached its peak in the smartphone segment and is now trying to grow with the market
* Tablets have similar regional distribution to smartphones
* Android shipments have been focused in North America (Kindle Fire), but APAC and Western Europe are coming strong from behind starting with Q2 
* iPad shipments regional distribution has been more representative for the overall market than Android (but Android catching up)

Questions welcome.


Note: please do NOT distribute the file outside of paid staff because it contains licensed data from IDC.
