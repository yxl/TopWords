That depends on whether you drive a car or take the bus. I LOVE the nav features on Android the few times per year that I drive around an unfamiliar city, but I don't own a car and almost exclusively take transit in my own city. I wonder how typical I am, vs the people that live in the valley and commute to MV.

For people upgrading from an iPhone 3gs or 4, it might be tempting to go to Android where you get all of these features and don't have to choose. I think it's a big gamble on Apple's part wrt their core, young, urban market.
