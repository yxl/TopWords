Hey Firefox for Android testers!,

This is a biweekly newsletter to those that are testing Firefox in any release channel. Our goal is to provide you with general mobile related news and guidance towards how and where you, as a tester can help out!  Our first newsletter will highlight general news and and status information about the Beta Channel.

General News:

    Telemetry has landed. Please enable  it!.  You can find this in the Preference->Feedback-> Send performance data.  Details on what Telemetry is does can be read on mfinkle's blog ( http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2011/08/firefox-mobile-send-performance-data/ )


    Ted has landed an addon called Android Symbol Sender ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/addon/android-symbol-sender/ ).  It provides us with symbols to look at a crash stack properly. Please install this if you are experiencing crashes in Firefox.

    If you are interested in the latest news regarding crashes on a weekly basis to see what is getting fixed and what remains, there is a weekly crash report available for viewing at: https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=QA/Fennec/crash_rep_19Sept2011

    If you do crash, please go to about:crashes and check to see if your crash was listed. If your crash was listed, please click on the link to verify that the crash was sent to Socorro.


    Bug 459117 is meta bug to help try to make Firefox for Android faster; this includes things such as panning, content refreshing, and making the startup time faster.
