It's bizarre, and is a clear signal of the degrading relationship between Apple & Google.

FWIW, I've always seen Google's place in opening up transit route data as being an odd one - many transit systems export to GTFS now, and there is a definite possibility that a central, open transit DB could be created. I would hope that transit authorities wouldn't take a step back in time and start charging iOS users for access to their data.
