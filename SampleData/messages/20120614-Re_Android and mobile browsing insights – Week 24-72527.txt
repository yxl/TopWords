Probably the biggest thing I've seen reported on social media about iOS6 is the dropping of Google Maps for the in-house Apple mapping solution, thereby stripping away a number of unique Google Maps features, including transit directions & streetview. IMO this is a major drop in functionality for iOS 6 over previous versions and I wonder if it will slow adoption or push people to Android phones that already have a better mapping app.
