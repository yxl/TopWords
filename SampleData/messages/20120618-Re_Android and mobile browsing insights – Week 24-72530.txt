Hi Jeff,

FYI there is an interesting, market-based discussion about this issue here:
http://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/06/public-transit-in-ios-6/

The short summary is that Apple likely a) could not get the necessary data b) could use it, but didn't want to involve Google and so c) is just letting transit firms provide it themselves and trying to take a cut through the App Store.

John
