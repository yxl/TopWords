And one late breaking addition: Andy Rubin is stepping down from leading Android. Sundar Pichai will take over.

Features promoted in the first - run experience are: off - road mode (switcher to proxy browsing), Speed Dial and Discover (content recommendation engine). The overall performance is good and smooth. The Discover feature gathers news based on location, the default one was the United States, even though I wasn't in the US when I installed it. The Settings menu is in the upper right corner and has a counter for data savings when enabling Off - Road Mode, in Bytes and %s.

Important for Firefox OS because Ice Cream Sandwich is starting to replace Gingerbread on entry - level devices in the emerging markets and Google is putting pressure on OEMs to pre - install it. The data - saving feature is particularly appealing in this segment.

If it is launching a device with HTC, one could speculate that a completely Facebook branded phone might not be in the pipeline just yet.
